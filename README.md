# httpbin

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin maintained by Kong. The main purpose of this fork is to have multi-arch images with both amd64 and arm64 support.

## Release procedure

To have a new image version, one needs to create a new Github release, and the new Docker image will be automatically built and pushed. The release has to be created manually, as there is no release automation in place.
